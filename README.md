#About
This repository contains the source code for solving the 15-Hole Peg Soltaire game in a number of different programming languages. It is based off the code Jonathan Fuerth wrote for his presentation on Java/HotSpot performance. You will find that presentation here -> https://sites.google.com/site/torontojava/2010-slides-and-notes-1/2010-02-21slides-javaperformance.pdf. 

*Spoiler alert*

His results showed that Java under the HotSpot VM is faster than C, which is considerably faster than everything else. I'm going to make it simple to run the JavaScript source under node.js to this experiment and then track the results with each release of node.js. My hypothesis is that JavaScript is going to dominate the Web Application stack as I expect the performance of V8 (and other JavaScript VMs for that matter) to reach and even eclipse the performance of the HotSpot VM.
